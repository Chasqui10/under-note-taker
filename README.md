  ## Description 
  Bootcamp Challenge 11 for Express.js. <br>The motivation for this project is to help develop an application that can help record my notes. I built this application to learn how to utilize Express.js to code the backend server communication and updating databases that the server is readingg from. The project helps solve the problem  by connecting the the client side  to a new backend server while utilizing the skills of modulization/helpers/middleware scripts to support feedback  throughout the process of web development.  From this project  I learend the importance of helpers, middleware, routees scripts. Utilizing Insominia to troubleshoot was a huge skill for understanding Express.js and built up my confidence with Front-end and Back-end servers.
